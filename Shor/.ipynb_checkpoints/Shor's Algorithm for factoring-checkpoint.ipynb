    "As we know already, the security of RSA is based on the use of a one-way function – prime factorization – which is related to the problem of period ﬁnding in modular exponentiation. As we saw, if one picks two prime numbers, $p$ and $q$, which multiply together to give a modulus $N$, then one can efﬁciently ﬁnd the modular exponentiation period $r$, and thus generate a public encryption key e and a private decryption key $d$. However, if we are just given the modulus $N$, then we are stuck, because there’s no known efﬁcient classical algorithm that lets us ﬁnd the prime factors $p$ and $q$, and so there’s no efﬁcient means to determine the period $r$. Thus, even if we reveal the modulus $N$ and the public encryption key $e$, there is no known efﬁcient way for an eavesdropper to calculate the private key $d$ on a classical computer. However, **if Eve has access to a quantum computer** that can run Shor’s Algorithm, then she can efﬁciently ﬁnd the modular exponentiation period r.  \n",

    "Let’s walk through Shor's algorithm, step by step, with the initialization stage. We need two registers of qubits for Shor’s Algorithm. Register 1 is used to store the results of a period ﬁnding protocol, which is implemented using the Quantum Fourier Transform. Register 2 is used to store the values of the modular exponentiation. This is the function that will apply in the compute section. The number of qubits in the ﬁrst register should generate a state space that is at least large enough to capture the maximum possible period, and do so at least twice to see it repeat. Let’s deﬁne N as twice the maximum period. So we need  \n",

And for simplicity, we’ll use the same number of qubits in the second register. By choosing 2L qubits, the number of states – $2^{2L} > N^2$. This guarantees that there are at least $N$ terms contributing to the probability amplitude when estimating the period, even as the period $r$ gets exponentially large, approaching $N/2$.  \n",

Multiplying out all $2L$ of these single qubit superposition states results in a single large equal superposition state with $2^{2L}$ components. From a component with $2L$ qubits in state $| 0 \\rangle$ to a component with all qubits in state $| 1 \\rangle$, and with all combinations in between.

The approach we adopt is based on [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0205095.pdf). We note that this function is implemented using ancilla qubits and it’s efﬁcient, requiring a number of gates that scales only polynomially with the number of qubits.  \n",

The resulting output values from the function $f$ are then stored in the Register 2 qubits. Since the values of the power $x$ are taken from the qubits in the ﬁrst register, implementing $f(x)$ makes a conditional connection between the qubits in Register 1 and those in Register 2. Although we ultimately won’t need to measure the qubits in Register 2, this step sets the stage for quantum interference and quantum parallelism to occur in Register 1 at the next step, which is the Quantum Fourier Transform. Here is how the circuit looks like. Below we will implement each building block of the circuit.\n",

Thus, it's easy to identify the location of the spikes and then read off the frequency directly. And if we know a signal's frequency, then we also know its period, since the frequency is $1/\\text{period}$.\\\\\n",

Although the output of the Quantum Fourier Transform is a large superposition state with transformed probability amplitudes, we generally can't access those amplitudes. Our measurement projects out only a single state, and even if we identically prepare the system and measure it many times, we only learn about the magnitude squared of the corresponding coefficients. We lose the phase information. So we don't have access to the probability amplitudes in the quantum computer, and this is quite different from the classical Fourier Transform where the entire output vector of complex numbers can be directly read.
