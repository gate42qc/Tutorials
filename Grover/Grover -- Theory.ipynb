    "\n",
    "## <center>Introduction</center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's algorithm is often described in the context of _searching an unstructured database_. One can generalize the search problem to the related problem of function inversion. Consider a function, $f(x)$, which can take on the value $0$ or $1$, depending on the argument $x$. For example, for $x = 10$, the function $f(10) = 1$, and it's $0$ for all other $x$ values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the function inversion problem is the following. Given $f(x) = 1$, can we find the value of $x$ or a value of $x$ if there is more than one solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/grover2.png' width=700 >  \n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, one has little choice but to try different x-values and test the function. So for $N$ total $x$-values of which $M$ satisfy $f(x) = 1$, it will take on the order of $N/M$ tries to succeed with high probability.\n",
    "However, on a quantum computer, the same task succeeds with high probability in only square root of $N$ over $M$ tries, a quadratic improvement over classical computing. And while a quadratic improvement may not seem like a lot, it does become practically significant for problems with large $N$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement Grover's algorithm, we need an operational block that can recognize if a test value of $x$ satisfies our function or not.  \n",
    "This operation is called an oracle. And it's a key part of each trial, which we'll call a Grover iteration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it may seem challenging or even cheating to define an oracle that represents, for example, our database.\n",
    "**After all, in loading such a database into our quantum computer, haven't we already searched it?**\n",
    "That's certainly true, but this isn't how an oracle works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it's worthwhile to think in terms of a mathematical function. The oracle doesn't need to know in advance every answer to every function call, nor does it need to have a ledger of all the input and output values.  \n",
    "Rather, it just needs to be able to calculate the function and recognize when a particular condition is satisfied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "And conceptually, we can program different functions into our oracle while keeping the underlying machinery in place. (_We won't discuss in detail how this is done, as it's obviously problem-dependent._)  \n",
    "But we just note that this type of oracle can be designed using **reversible logic approaches.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Grover's algorithm is the following. We start with an index register of values $x$ running from $[0, N - 1]$.  \n",
    "The oracle takes a test value $x$, calculates the function $f(x)$, and performs modulo-2 addition of $f(x)$ with a helper qubit, which we'll call the oracle qubit. The oracle qubit is prepared in a superposition state  \n",
    "$$\\lvert q\\rangle = \\frac{\\lvert 0\\rangle - \\lvert 1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center> **The Oracle** </center>  \n",

    "\\begin{array}{cc} \n",

    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are $N$ possible values of $x$, we'll choose $n = \\log N$ qubits for register $1$. And register $2$ will hold a single qubit, which is the oracle qubit. Register $1$ qubits are prepared in the equal superposition state $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}\\lvert x\\rangle$ and the oracle qubit in state $\\frac{\\lvert 0\\rangle - \\lvert 1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to implement a Grover iteration on the order of $\\sqrt{N}$ times to obtain a solution with order unit probability.  Each iteration contains the oracle operator $O$, which with the help of the oracle qubit, will leave a $-1$ on the register $1$ states for values $x$ which satisfy $f(x) = 1$. It's a reflection operation. The remainder of the Grover iteration is a conditional phase shift, nestled between Hadamard gates, which leaves state $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ alone and, otherwise, places a $-1$ phase shift in front of all other states $\\lvert x\\rangle$. This can be written in terms of an equal superposition state, just like the one we started with. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = H^{\\otimes n}(2\\lvert 0\\rangle \\langle 0 \\rvert - I)H^{\\otimes n} = 2\\lvert \\psi\\rangle \\langle \\psi \\rvert - I.$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This set of three operations can also be viewed as a reflection, this time, across the vector $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "Together with the oracle, these two reflections in the Grover iteration serve to rotate the quantum state by an angle $\\theta$ (see below for geometrical interpretation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**To sum up**, Grover's algorithm can be decomposed into three steps: \n",
    "1. Initialization of the system, \n",
    "1. an Oracle operator $O$, and\n",
    "1. a (second) reflection operator $W$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of $N = 2^n$ items, the system is initialized in the $n = \\log N$-qubit equal superposition state. The Oracle operator encodes and marks the information in the list onto the quantum system; this can be viewed as the first reflection. Once the list is encoded, the operator $W$ applies a second reflection. The resulting state after these two operations is closer to the solution state corresponding to the marked item. The product of the two reflections $G = WO$ -- the Grover iteration -- is applied several times, and the number of repetitions necessary to find the marked item is upper bounded by $\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\sqrt{N}$."
