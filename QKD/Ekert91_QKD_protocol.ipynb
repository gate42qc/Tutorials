    "## *Introduction*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various forms of quantum key distribution or QKD described by different protocols. They all make use of quantum mechanical properties to establish shared lists of random numbers that can be used for encryption. One such protocol is the BB84 QKD protocol where one user, Alice, prepares a speciﬁc state that she sends to another user, Bob. Bob then measures the state, and Alice and Bob then perform sifting by comparing the preparation bases and the measurement bases, and then follow several classical postprocessing steps to establish secure encryption keys. Protocols of this sort, which make use of *quantum superposition* where one party prepares a state and the other party measures it, are called *prepare and measure* QKD protocols. An alternative set of protocols are called *entanglement-based* protocols, and they make use of entanglement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A related entanglement-based protocol is **E91 or Ekert91** protocol, invented by Artur Ekert in 1991. In this protocol, a transmitter consisting of an entanglement source generates a two-photon entangled state known as a **maximally entangled Bell state**, with one photon being sent to Alice and the other photon being sent to Bob. The photons are sent across quantum communication channels that can reliably transmit the single-photon states and preserve their entanglement. The relevant property of Bell states is that the photons are *correlated in multiple measurement bases*. For an ideal transmission across the channel, if Alice and Bob choose the same measurement basis, their measurement results will be perfectly correlated between the measurement devices, but individual measurements at each side will look random. Alternately, if Alice chooses, say, $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$ basis and Bob chooses the $\\{|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle\\}$ measurement basis, the measurements will not be correlated at all. And for intermediate basis choices, their measurements will be *partly correlated*.\n"
